\section{Experience}
%\subsection{Research}
\cventry{Jun. 2014 \,--\, Present}{Help Desk Tech/Application Support}{Full Time}{Lansing Community College}{}{
%As a postdoc, I joined the ATLAS collaboration at CERN. The focus of my work was performing research and contributing to the MSU physics department's technical documentation wiki.
After being hired for a full time position I continued my previous Help Desk Technican duties
in addition to serving as a member on new and ongoing project initiatives.
%Detailed achievements:%
\begin{itemize}%
%\setlength\multicolsep{2pt}
\item Worked with a small team and vendors to build, test, and implement LCC's ticketing and project/enterprise service management platform from the ground up.
\begin{itemize}%
\item Transitioned the ITS Department from an outdated ticketing system to a new ticketing and enterprise service management platform solution.
\item Met with other departments to discuss their needs and desired outcomes both in service management and project management in an attempt to centralize service/project requests.
\item Create demonstrations, training materials and offer training sessions to allow a smooth transition into the ticketing system.
\item Automated routine tasks utilizing basic Python scripts in conjunction with the ticketing system API.
\item Administrate/maintain/update the service catalog, ticketing system, reports, and automation rules based on feedback from the departments that use the system.
\end{itemize}
\item Regularly attend conferences and webinars and participate in community forums to stay up to date with enterprise service management best practices and procedures.
%\item Gained advanced experience supporting educational technology systems and applications by assisting student and staff.
%\item Aided colleagues in finding solutions to technical issues with software and services.
%\item Assisted student welcome week, represented the Help Desk for faculty enrichment days, and gave presentations on services provided.
\item Attend campus events which focus on better serving the LCC Community.

\item Gained advanced experience supporting educational technology systems and applications by assisting students and staff.
\item Aided colleagues in finding solutions to technical issues with software and services.
\item Assisted with Student Welcome Week, represented the Help Desk for Faculty Enrichment Days, and gave presentations on services provided.
\item Facilitated departmental cross-communication to assist in troubleshooting hardware and software issues.
\item Assisted in testing new procedures and systems prior to deployment and provided documentation of feedback and potential issues.
%\item Respond to/resolve submitted requests in the areas of ERP Security, ERP Student, Course
%Management System, Identity Management System, and other areas as time permits.
\item Trained new Help Desk employees.
%\item Participated in collaborative software development under version control:
%\begin{itemize}

%\item Wrote scripts to automate tasks associated with running the analysis.
\end{itemize}}
%\item Administrated approximately ten machines running Scientific Linux:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Installed two desktop nodes and one RAID array for use in a computer cluster accessible by over 350 people 24/7.
%\item Performed hardware/software troubleshooting and maintenance both on- and off-site.
%\end{itemize}
%\item Analyzed large, complex data sets:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Tested data models against collected data using a statistics-based approach.
%\item Manipulated data into complex data formats for reading and plotting.
%\item Leveraged machine learning techniques to search for patterns.
%\item Produced plots to investigate hypotheses and accurately portray results.
%\item Performed signal-to-noise ratio optimization in data.
%\end{itemize}
%\item Presented my analysis progress and results to wide audiences at conferences and weekly meetings.
%\item Participated in rotating shifts monitoring the safety and performance of the D0 detector.
%\item Published my thesis research in a peer-reviewed scientific journal while serving as corresponding author on behalf of the collaboration.
